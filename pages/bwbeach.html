                <p class="bw">This title is stolen from a song by Summer Salt of the same name.  I strongly associate
                    photogrpahy and music.  I practically can hear it when I take photos. <br>Eventually I may have 
                    some color shots to add to these but for now this 
                    is all black and white taken with Ilford FP4 plus film.  These are from a short trip I took to Long Beach, WA.
                    I really like it there partially because it reminds me of where I grew up
                    in NJ.  I also just love any coast in general, because they're edge places.  You can see where
                    two worlds meet and there's so much to take in visually.
